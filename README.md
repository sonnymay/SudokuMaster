## Introduction

Sudoku is a popular number puzzle that requires you to fill a 9x9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 grids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. SudokuMaster takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and provides the solution.

## Installation

To run SudokuMaster, make sure you have Python 3 installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Clone the SudokuMaster repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/SudokuMaster.git

```

## Usage

SudokuMaster is easy to use. Simply update the `sudoku_board` variable in `sudoku_solver.py` with your unsolved Sudoku puzzle and run the script:

```sh
python sudoku_solver.py
```

This will print the solved Sudoku board to the console.
